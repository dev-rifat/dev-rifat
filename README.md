# Hi 👋, I'm Md. Lutfar Rahman

I'm a passionate **Flutter Developer** who loves solving real-world problems through clean, scalable, and high-performance mobile applications. My toolbox includes **Flutter, Dart, GetX, Firebase, REST & GraphQL APIs**, and a wide ecosystem of modern mobile technologies.

I believe great apps are built through **collaboration, creativity, and continuous learning**. Whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect UIs or building robust and maintainable app architectures, I enjoy bringing ideas to life — from concept to deployment.

Currently, I’m building awesome things at **Gain Solutions Ltd (gainhq.com)** as a **Flutter Developer**, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful and high-quality digital products for both **Android & iOS**.
